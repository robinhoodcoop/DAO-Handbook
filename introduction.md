## What is RHC? 

Robin Hood Cooperative started in 2012 as a wall-street alternative hedge fund with the goal of providing grants to commons-building projects and research using a portion of the profits from its investments. The commons are any shared space or resource or means of production, whether in the form of goods, knowledge, processes, intelligence, rights, procedures, institutes, commodities, ideas, space etc. RHC is now finalizing its transformation into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. In addition to maintaining pursuit of its original goal of fostering commons-building, RHC as a DAO introduces means by which members can receive education on long-volatility bias investment theory and quantitative finance and earn additional ownership for contributing to the creation of investment algorithms that are deployed on the DAO's behalf.

A key aspect to the ethos of Robin Hood Cooperative is the desire to create opportunities in which members can both provide and benefit from mutual aid. The following sections provide an overview of the two primary components of RHC in which mutual aid is most exhibited.

### Mutual Aid Through Commons-Building Grants
The second aspect in which RHC provides an opportunity for mutual aid resides in the ability of the DAO to maintain an account for awarding grants to commons-building projects. The capital of the DAO will be managed entirely by a set of algorithmic trading bots created by members of the DAO, with each bot having its own fee structure that specifies the portion of the profits that are automatically directed into the Commons Fund. As the DAO's investments realize profit, the specified portion of capital is automatically redirected into the Commons Fund, providing the DAO with the ability to receive grant proposals from non-members and members alike and provide awards to projects based upon the value they add to the commons as decided by the democratic voice of the members through the DAO Governance Protocol, a democratic and transparent governance system.


### Motivation of RHC as a DAO

We have been in contact with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanssivalvonta, FIN-FSA) since 2015. A new round of discussions started in the spring 2020. After discussions about the aims, structure and next steps of the coop, FIN-FSA informed us (15.9.2020) of their detailed analysis and a provided a conclusion that the coop would need to register or apply for a licence as a so-called Alternative Investment Fund (AIF; which has a specific legal definition) or change its functioning so that the assets can be directly managed by all the members on a day-to-day basis i.e. that there is no centralized “third party” who is providing the investment product/service for the members, there is no exchange service etc. A further complication was that the law on Alternative Investment Funds does not recognize a cooperative, i.e. a cooperative cannot become an AIF. Basically the conclusion was that the coop could not continue functioning as it was.

The coop replied (6.10.2020) to FIN-FSA’s analysis that it will propose to its general meeting a transition to a new model operating in a decentralized way as a protocol/smart contract library.  We had already devised the plan (Robin Hood as a DAO), its first phase was implemented, but we would need to speed the transition. The operating model of the coop as a smart contract library was then presented to FIN-FSA on 7.12.2020. We are convinced that the proposed model (RHC DAO Phase 2), which builds upon the development work started already in the Phase1, answers all key regulatory requirements. FIN-FSA has yet been unable to conclude upon it-- they hoped to discuss it first further with their colleges in Europe and requested that we let them know what the coop decides in the general meeting asap.

## Ethereum as a Foundational Ecosystem

Ethereum is the world’s first programmable blockchain.
Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a global, open-source platform used for programmable money and decentralized applications that allow users to have control over their own data.
Ethereum applications, commonly called **Smart Contracts**, are diverse and span a range of industries and use-cases. They might be financial (like payments, lending, or insurance), games (like collectible cards, or virtual worlds), identity related (self-sovereign ID) or something entirely different. Each “web 3” application benefits from censorship resistance, decentralization, and security.
Ethereum is not controlled by anyone--it is built and maintained by thousands of people, companies, organizations and users all over the world.

With Ethereum, we can build a censorship-resitant, decentralized, and transparent organization.


## Smart Contracts

When the Ethereum Foundation mentioned decentralized applications, they were primarily referring to **smart contracts**. Without getting overly technical, a solid working definition of what a smart contract is can be broken down into [two general components](https://otcpm24.com/2020/11/18/blockchain-enabled-smart-contracts-what-are-they-and-what-they-mean-for-blockchain-development/). 

1. A blockchain-augmented representation of a traditional contract, complete with counter-parties, rights, obligations, and consideration being transferred between these counter-parties. 
2. An immutable distributed application that allows the execution of either a portion of, or the entirety of, contractual rights and obligations with less human oversight and management.

The implication of this definition of smart-contracts is that we can begin to encode our relationships, agreements, and obligations into an immutable programatic agreement in which certain actions can automatically trigger events outlined by the agreement, without a third-party overseeing execution of the agreement. 

## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

Since we now know that we can encode our relationships and agreements into an immutable, transparent, and decentralized program which executes agreed upon events based on certain triggers, we can begin to imagine how a cooperative hedge fund can encode its organizational structure into a smart contract.

A DAO generally refers to a group of people who organize and cooperate according to a set of agreements encoded in a smart-contract. Much like a traditional state-recognized business vehicle, this set of agreements expresses the relationships between and the rights of members, as well as the process by which amendments can be made to the agreement. An important aspect of DAOs is the degree to which amendments can be made. Though certain parameterized values are described in this document, flexibility of and potential for self-evolution is highly encouraged and accessible when compared to a traditional business vehicle.

There are a number of existing projects and experiments exploring the potential for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and in this first version of RHC as a DAO, our focus is on adapting pre-existing projects and tools to fit the specific context of a Commons-Empowering Hedge Fund.


## Related Projects
 
RHC as a DAO will be built using the existing smart-contract software projects [Moloch v2](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch) and [Enzyme](https://melonprotocol.com/)  and takes inspiration from other projects like the [Set Protocol](https://www.setprotocol.com/?ref=cryptocurrencyjobs.co), [PrimeDAO](https://primedao.eth.link/#/), [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/), and others.
