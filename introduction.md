## What is RHC? 

Robin Hood Cooperative started in 2012 as a wall-street alternative hedge fund that aimed to empower the commonwealth by using the profits of their investments to provide grants to commons-oriented projects and research. RHC is now finalizing its transformation into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. RHC as a DAO educates members on long-volatility bias investment theory and quantitative finance and rewards them for completing lessons or contributing to investment algorithms that are used to manage the Guild's capital. A portion of the profits accrued from the investments are then used to provide grants to independent projects that benefit the crypto-commons. 

The birth of Robin Hood as a DAO

## Why Now?

We have been in contact with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanssivalvonta, FIN-FSA) since 2015. A new round of discussions started in the spring 2020. After discussions about the aims, structure and next steps of the coop, FIN-FSA informed us (15.9.2020) of their detailed analysis and a provided a conclusion that the coop would need to register or apply for a licence as a so-called Alternative Investment Fund (AIF; which has a specific legal definition) or change its functioning so that the assets can be directly managed by all the members on a day-to-day basis i.e. that there is no centralized “third party” who is providing the investment product/service for the members, there is no exchange service etc. A further complication was that the law on Alternative Investment Funds does not recognize a cooperative, i.e. a cooperative cannot become an AIF. Basically the conclusion was that the coop could not continue functioning as it was.

The coop replied (6.10.2020) to FIN-FSA’s analysis that it will propose to its general meeting a transition to a new model operating in a decentralized way as a protocol/smart contract library.  We had already devised the plan (Robin Hood as a DAO), its first phase was implemented, but we would need to speed the transition. The operating model of the coop as a smart contract library was then presented to FIN-FSA on 7.12.2020. We are convinced that the proposed model (RHC DAO Phase 2), which builds upon the development work started already in the Phase1, answers all key regulatory requirements. FIN-FSA has yet been unable to conclude upon it-- they hoped to discuss it first further with their colleges in Europe and requested that we let them know what the coop decides in the general meeting asap.

## Ethereum as a Foundational Ecosystem

Ethereum is the world’s first programmable blockchain.
Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a global, open-source platform used for programmable money and decentralized applications that allow users to have control over their own data.
Ethereum applications, commonly called **Smart Contracts**, are diverse and span a range of industries and use-cases. They might be financial (like payments, lending, or insurance), games (like collectible cards, or virtual worlds), identity related (self-sovereign ID) or something entirely different. Each “web 3” application benefits from censorship resistance, decentralization, and security.
Ethereum is not controlled by anyone--it is built and maintained by thousands of people, companies, organizations and users all over the world.

With Ethereum, we can build a censorship-resitant, decentralized, and transparent organization.


## Smart Contracts

When the Ethereum Foundation mentioned decentralized applications, they were primarily referring to **smart contracts**. Without getting overly technical, a solid working definition of what a smart contract is can be broken down into [two general components](https://otcpm24.com/2020/11/18/blockchain-enabled-smart-contracts-what-are-they-and-what-they-mean-for-blockchain-development/). 

1. A blockchain-augmented representation of a traditional contract, complete with counter-parties, rights, obligations, and consideration being transferred between these counter-parties. 
2. A distributed application that allows the execution of either a portion of, or the entirety of, contractual rights and obligations with less human oversight and management.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

To solve incentive misalignment problems, incentives must be restructed. To do this, we aim to utilize and build on top of smart contracts that perform this restructuring. The purpose of this project is to decentralize governance and fund management of the cooperative and the following sections will highlight how exactly this will be done.

RHC 3.0 will be built using the existing smart-contract software projects [Moloch v2](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch) and [Enzyme](https://melonprotocol.com/)  and takes inspiration from other projects like the [Set Protocol](https://www.setprotocol.com/?ref=cryptocurrencyjobs.co), [PrimeDAO](https://primedao.eth.link/#/), [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/), and others.
