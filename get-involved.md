## Strategy Development

In an effort to provide our members with the knowledge and tools necessary to create automated investment strategies that can be proposed as yield funds, we will begin two new education initatives. After completing these courses, members will be well equipped to begin contributing to the creation of automated investment strategies. In order to incentivize participation in these courses and contribution to yield fund strategies, it is possible for the coop to propose and vote on reward structures that use yield share tokens to reward members upon completion of courses and acceptance of contributions. Both courses will be recorded and available in a digital format so that members that have time conflicts can still have access to the course.


These are the two courses that will be introduced:

#### Introduction to Markets

Taught by Roberto Soundy, this course will cover the basics of financial markets and economic theory. There will be an emphasis on fragility, robustness, and anti-fragility and how to exploit these characteristics in financial instruments. Taking this course will enable a member to acquire the knowledge necessary to understand financial markets and form hypothesis that can be used to build investment strategies.


#### Introduction to Financial Python
Taught by Theodore Morales, this course will cover the basics of the Python programming language as well as the open-source backtesting and trading engine LEAN. Taking this course will enable a member to automate the management of a portfolio according to rules created using the financial theory they learned in the Introduction To Markets course.
