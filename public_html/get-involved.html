<h2 id="applying-for-membership">Applying For Membership</h2>
<p>An individual can become a member of the cooperative by submitting an off-chain <a href="https://www.robinhoodcoop.org/apply">membership application</a> and an on-chain proposal for membership through DAOHaus.</p>
<p>Application responses will be used by Tuck to generate a membership proposal which, with the exception of omitting steps 1.1-1.3, will follow the DGP Protocol (see below) for voting and approval by the DAO. Once the membership proposal has been created, the applicant will need to login to DAOHaus and submit the membership proposal on-chain, depositing the tribute or investment they are offering in exchange for membership.</p>
<p>The membership application will have two main sections; Personal Information and Membership Proposition. In order to maintain legal compliance, the personal information section will collect information to fulfill the KYC, or, Know-Your-Customer, regulatory standard. This information is confidential and will not be shared with third-parties or other members of the DAO.</p>
<p>The Membership Proposition section will be comprised of the following prompts, the responses to which should help provide the DAO with the information they need to assess the potential value of adding the applicant as a member:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please give a short introduction about yourself.</li>
<li>Why do you want to join Robin Hood?</li>
<li>How can you contribute to the continued growth and sustainability of Robin Hood DAO and the fulfillment of its main goals (mutual-aid through ‘risking-together’ and commons-oriented empowerment through grant funding)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the membership application has been submitted, the next step for the applicant is to submit a proposal for membership through DaoHaus.</p>
<p>Note: Before submitting an application, be sure to review the <em>Claiming a Blockchain Identity</em> and <em>Logging into DAOHaus</em> sections to learn about wallets and how to login to DAOHaus.</p>
<p>In order to submit a proposal, you’ll want to first navigate to the <a href="https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x2a/0x7d317054229031579483f0d09384e9c64982b346/proposals">DAO Proposal Page</a> and create a new proposal</p>

</figure>
<p>Note that the proposal fields must be specified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title: Proposal For Membership</li>
<li>Description: <applicant name></li>
<li>Shares Requested: <number of shares requested></li>
<li>Tribute Offered: &lt;Shares Requested * 35&gt;</li>
<li>Link: www.robinhoodcoop.org/apply</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll notice through the tribute offered field that shares are worth 35 DAI each.</p>
<p>Upon being granted membership by the DAO, new members will receive one Membership Token, referred to in DAOHaus as a share. This token is an ERC-20 standard crypto-token representing a non-transferrable membership right; a pro-rata share of the value of the DAO Bank, and a voting right.</p>
<p>Additionally, prospective members can apply for Loot Tokens alongside their Membership Token. Loot Tokens represent economic shares of the value of the DAO Bank, without the voting right. The purpose of having both Loot and Membership Tokens is to allow members to invest as much as they would like in the cooperative, without stripping the organization of its democratic nature. The payment for the tokens is added to the DAO Bank upon acceptance and paid back at exit.</p>
<h3 id="claiming-a-blockchain-identity">Claiming a Blockchain Identity</h3>
<p>Before you are able to interact with DaoHaus though, you need to claim your blockchain identity. When we talk about a blockchain identity, we are talking about an identification system that uses private and public keys to verify and guarantee the identity of an entity on the blockchain. An intuitive way to think about how your blockchain identity is stored is by thinking of the way in which we use business cards and drivers licenses. Your public key is like a business card, which you’d want to be published and shared as much as possible so that other people know how to get in contact with you. Your private key on the other hand, is like your drivers license, and this component is not something you want published anyhwere at all. In fact, you’d want to be the only person who has your drivers license (or private key) so that anytime someone contacts you using the information on your business card, you can verify your identity to them using the posession of your drivers license. Public and private keys are just a way to maintain your identity and interact with others in the world of blockchain.</p>
<p>Technical Note: we don’t actually use public keys to share our identities, we share addresses, which are the last 20 bytes of the hashes of the public keys</p>
<p>Since this is your identity we are talking about and you need to posess proof of your identity to trade, buy, or sell crypto-currency, it’s quite important to emphasize the need for proper digital security practices. Wallets are applications that store your private keys, and while they come in many different flavors, they can generally be boiled down to two different categories; hot and cold wallets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet and therefore offer convenience when trying to interact with blockchains, but in exchange for this convenience, there is generally a much greater risk of cybertheft as anyone on the internet can try to login to your account (which is why you should always use a password manager to prevent password cracking or guessing). Cold wallets on the other hand are not connected to the internet and as such, are generally far safer than hot wallets. Cold wallets typically come in the form of a hardware (see <a href="https://shop.trezor.io">trezor</a> and <a href="https://ledger.com">ledger</a>) or paper wallet. For storing large amounts of crypto-currency, its always advisable to choose a cold-wallet, but for small transactions and verification of identity on browser-based applications, hot-wallets are generally more convenient.</p>
<p>For interaction with the DAO, you can use metamask or any walletconnect supported wallet. If this is your first wallet, we suggest using metamask; an ethereum hot-wallet that is integrated with your web-browser in order to allow for easy interaction with smart contracts. In addition to being able to store Ethereum, metamask can store any Ethereum (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) based coins, including the Loot and Membership tokens that are issued by the DAO. To install the browser plugin and setup an account, visit <a href="https://metamask.io/download.html">Metamask</a>.</p>
<h3 id="customizing-your-identity-with-idx-formerly-3box">Customizing your Identity With IDX (formerly 3box)</h3>
<p>So now that we know how similar a public key is to a business card, the possibility of personalization arises. When you open an account in metamask, your public key is going to look something like this: <code>0xba90f600cc648d3e71781d7222e45dff02012d72</code>. This format may be optimal for the Ethereum Virtual Machine but it’s certainly not pleasant or memorable to humans! IDX is a decentralized platform for wrapping your public key in a web3 profile, allowing you to link your social media accounts, blogs, and github to the same identity. The result is an environment where your information isn’t stored in a centralized server belonging to robinhood but instead on the IPFS. Currently DAOHaus has not integrated the latest version of IDX so we will not be using it until future versions, though you’re free to make a 3box account in the meantime as all information will be transfered!</p>
<h3 id="logging-into-daohaus">Logging into DAOHaus</h3>
<p>To login into the on-chain platform using your newly created identity, you will want to head over to the <a href="https://app.daohaus.club/">DAOHaus Hub</a>. As soon as you open the site, click the ‘Connect Wallet’ button in the top right. At this point, you will have the option to connect either a MetaMask or WalletConnect wallet. After choosing your wallet and signing in, your identity will be linked to DAOHaus and you’ll be able to start taking interacting with DAOs!</p>
<h3 id="accessing-the-dao">Accessing the DAO</h3>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, you’ll notice that there are a plethora of other DAOs that you can learn about and submit proposals for! The majority of these magic internet communities are also built using Moloch so you’ll find that much of what you’ll learn as a member of RHC will equip you with the ability to explore the wider DAO community as a whole! Once you’ve spent some time looking around, you’ll want to head to the <a href="https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x2a/0x7d317054229031579483f0d09384e9c64982b346">Robinhood DAO Home Page</a>. This is where you can view and interact with the state of our DAO.</p>

<p>In an effort to provide our members with the knowledge and tools necessary to create automated investment strategies that can be proposed as Vault-Bots, we will begin two new education initatives.</p>
<p>After completing these courses, members will be well equipped to begin contributing to the creation of Vault-Bots as part of either the Strategy Design or Strategy Engineering Working Group depending on their skill-set and course taken.</p>
<p>Both courses will be available in a digital format so that members can have access to the content at anytime.</p>
<p>In order to incentivize participation in these courses and contribution to Vault-Bot development, it is possible for the coop to propose and vote on reward structures that use loot tokens to reward members for completing courses.</p>
<p>Decisions like the adoption of course-completion rewards embody the potential flexibility and creativity of the organization that can be cultivated by using this new governance system where all members can propose and vote on ideas. The idea of RHC as a DAO is to give the community the power to govern itself democratically with as few limitations as possible.</p>
<p>These are the two courses that will be introduced:</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-markets">Introduction to Markets</h4>
<p>Taught by Roberto Soundy, this course will cover the basics of financial markets and economic theory. There will be an emphasis on fragility, robustness, and anti-fragility and how to exploit these characteristics in financial instruments.</p>
<p>Taking this course will enable a member to acquire the knowledge necessary to understand financial markets and form hypothesis that can be used to build investment strategies.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-typescript-and-the-enzyme-sdk">Introduction to TypeScript and the Enzyme SDK</h4>
<p>Taught by Theo Morales, this course will cover the basics of object-oriented programming with Typescript and building Vault-Bots with the Enzyme SDK.</p>
<p>Taking this course will provide members with the technical skills necessary to join the Strategy Engineering Working Group and build a Vault-Bot based on a long-volatility strategy designed by the Strategy Design Working Group with the knowledge gained from the Introduction to Markets Course.</p>
