<h2 id="educational-opportunities">Educational Opportunities</h2>
<p>In an effort to provide our members with the knowledge and tools necessary to create automated investment strategies that can be proposed as Vault-Bots, we will begin two new education initatives.</p>
<p>After completing these courses, members will be well equipped to begin contributing to the creation of Vault-Bots as part of either the Strategy Design or Strategy Engineering Working Group depending on their skill-set and course taken.</p>
<p>Both courses will be available in a digital format so that members can have access to the content at anytime.</p>
<p>In order to incentivize participation in these courses and contribution to Vault-Bot development, it is possible for the coop to propose and vote on reward structures that use loot tokens to reward members for completing courses.</p>
<p>Decisions like the adoption of course-completion rewards embody the potential flexibility and creativity of the organization that can be cultivated by using this new governance system where all members can propose and vote on ideas. The idea of RHC as a DAO is to give the community the power to govern itself democratically with as few limitations as possible.</p>
<p>These are the two courses that will be introduced:</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-markets">Introduction to Markets</h4>
<p>Taught by Roberto Soundy, this course will cover the basics of financial markets and economic theory. There will be an emphasis on fragility, robustness, and anti-fragility and how to exploit these characteristics in financial instruments.</p>
<p>Taking this course will enable a member to acquire the knowledge necessary to understand financial markets and form hypothesis that can be used to build investment strategies.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-to-typescript-and-the-enzyme-sdk">Introduction to TypeScript and the Enzyme SDK</h4>
<p>Taught by Theo Morales, this course will cover the basics of object-oriented programming with Typescript and building Vault-Bots with the Enzyme SDK.</p>
<p>Taking this course will provide members with the technical skills necessary to join the Strategy Engineering Working Group and build a Vault-Bot based on a long-volatility strategy designed by the Strategy Design Working Group with the knowledge gained from the Introduction to Markets Course.</p>
