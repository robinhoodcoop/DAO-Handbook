[[##]] Yield Funds

Through the use of the [Enzyme Platform](https://melonprotocol.com/), we will enable the community to make decisions about 'yield funds' using the proposal protocol and have those decisions be implemented automatically. 

A *yield fund* is defined as:

- An econometric investment vehicle that automatically rebalances its holdings according to a pre-defined strategy and is offered to investors on the enzyme platform.

Through the proposal protocol, members of the cooperative will be able to make proposals including but not limited to; 

- Implementation of a yield fund idea 
- Adoption of a new yield fund
- Changes to existing yield funds including fee strucutures
- And decomissioning of a yield fund.

Each yield fund will have a fee structure that will be defined by the co-op upon adoption. This fee structure defines how much of the profits will be reinvested into the commons fund, how much will be paid as dividends to investors, and how much will be reinvested into growth and operations of the co-op.

Yield Funds may be decomissioned at any time if the community proposes and passes a vote on it. There may also be set kill-switches or limits to losses that the yield fund may incurr before automatically liquidating all of its positions to prevent further losses. The adoption of kill-switches is up to the co-op and can be created through proposals and voting. 

Decisions like the adoption of kill-switches embody the potential flexibility and creativity of the organization that can be cultivated by using this new governance system where all members can propose and vote on ideas. The idea of RHC 3.0 is to give the community the power to govern itself democratically with as few limitations as possible.

Access to Yield Funds will not be limited only to members, but will be available to all investors on the Enzyme platform. Enzyme itself is a smart contract protocol that allows fund managers and fund investors to connect in a transparent manner. Enzyme will take care of accounting and collection of fees and will mint **Yield Fund Crypto-Tokens** (which can be thought of as traditional fund shares, representing investment in the fund) that will be transferred to investors upon investment. Investors can redeem their yield fund tokens at any time.

Initially, the yield funds will only invest in crypto-assets. Eventually, we will venture into offering yield funds that hold traditional assets as well. 


## Yield Share 

At any time, a member can use ETH to purchase non-voting **Yield Share Tokens** which represent an equal-weight investment into all of the currently active yield funds. These tokens can be redeemed at any time and are transferrable to other members as well as 3rd parties. 


## The Commons Fund 

The **Commons Fund** is an account that is funded by fees collected on Yield Funds. The exact structure is up to the cooperative to decide but viable options for fee structures include:

- Having x percent of profits diverted into Commons Fund
- Charging x ETH for each purchase of yield fund tokens
- Charging x ETH for redemption of yield fund tokens
- Diverting x percent of all yield share sales into commons fund

Once funded, this account will be used [[for]] awarding grants to commons-oriented projects that the co-op has approved through a funding proposal.

Funding proposals follow the same life-cycle as all other proposals and will have specific application forms that applicants will need to complete.

Funding structure for commons-oriented projects may be determined on a per-project basis, or may be defined globally.
